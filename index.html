    <p>Arena is the first of a CRPG game series called <i>The Elder Scrolls</i>, made by <i>Bethesda Softworks</i>. The project was led by Vijay Lakshman. The game boasts a 3D world you can walk and interact in, similar to <i>Ultima: Underworld</i>, as well as a variety of classes you can roleplay as, allowing many playstyles distinct from one another.</p>
