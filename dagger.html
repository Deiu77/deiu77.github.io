  <p><i>The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall</i> is rearing for release sometime around 1995-1996. The brand new X(n)gine allows for true 3D enviroments that can be navigated in all 3 dimensions. A detailed class creation system, new spells, and horses are just a small taste of what is to be expected from Daggerfall. The world will react to your standing between certain factions, for better or for worse.</p>

  <p>If I was to describe every feature to be in Daggerfall, this page would be much too long. This game is expected to surpass Arena in every way, and will define CRPGs for generations to come. Look forward to it, and contact Bethsoft for your pre-order copy today!</p>
