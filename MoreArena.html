    <p>Uriel Septim VII and his general Talin Warhaft are visited by the Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, pictured left. Jagar Tharn imprisons them to another dimension of his choosing, and taking the guise of Emperor. He can't kill Uriel, as with the Amulet of Kings he has, the Elder Council will be alerted. There's only one way to free them, by using the power of the Staff of Chaos. The staff itself is indestructable, being tied to the land. However, the continent of Tamriel was split into several provinces. Tied to the land, the staff could also be split into several pieces. Jagar has hidden these pieces in only the most dangerous places in Tamriel. You are a lowly Imperial Councilman who spoke against the Emperor, who was Jagar Tharn. He threw you in jail. There's no escape... but Jagar acted in arrogance by letting you live. You were friends with Ria Silmane, Jagar Tharn's apprentice. She died attempting to warn the Elder Council of his evil. Using her power as a sorceress, she contacts you beyond the grave, to guide and help you stop him. However, Tamriel is a dangerous Arena, with everything standing in your way. Can you survive to gain power and strike down Jagar Tharn?</p>

    <h3 class="centertext">You and your claims to fame</h3>
    <p>You are one of 18 classes, distinct in playstyle. They can be classified under a Warrior-type class, a Mage-type class, and a Thief-type class. Warrior-type classes are defined by having good armor and weapons. Mage-type classes are the only ones to be able to cast spells. Thief-type classes have higher success chances for lockpicking, and are able to sometimes deal a Critical Strike, doing 3x the damage! Your weapons and armor can be bought from shops found in each city, or found in dungeons. Every class has a different selection of weapons and armor they can equip! Of course, there are rumors of mystical artifacts crafted by gods...</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Spells are also around for you magical types. Your standard spells are here. Burn your enemies with fire, freeze them with ice, or shock them with lightning. Patch yourself up with healing, and bolster your abilites with various boosts like Shield to absorb your blows. These are alongside more surprising spells. Destory and raise walls, and levitate off the ground! If you have creativity, you can make your own spells with a variety of effects. Don't have the ability to cast spells? For a fee, you can purchase enchanted items and potions.
